# Word-Guess-CLI

David Ferro

## Description

This is a Beatles themed command line word/phrase guessing game that utilizes constructors in order to display the words and the individual letters of each word.  The game is build using JavaScript, Node.js, and npm inquirer.

Before playing the game, make sure you have downloaded the `package.json` file as well as have node.js installed on your computer.  Then run `npm install` through the command line in the file folder with the `package.json` file.

Then, to start the game, type in `node index.js` in the command line, and the game will begin.  You will see the number of letters that you need to guess, shown by underscores.  If you guess correctly, the letter will fill in, otherwise, you will lose one of your incorrect guesses.  You are only allowed 9 incorrect guesses (as an homage to 'Revolution 9').  Once you have correctly guessed all of the letters or run out of incorrect guesses, the number of wins and losses will be displayed, and you will be given the option to play again or to end the game.
